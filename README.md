# Sinatra To-Do List Manager Project

## Overview

This To-Do List manager is a web app run on the Sinatra framework where a user can sign-up with a password protected username and manage their own set of to-do lists. It is a locally hosted app, so the user will need to use shotgun or rackup in order to access the app from their browser. In the app, a user can create, edit, read and delete their to-do lists as well as the individual to-do items themselves. 

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed bundler. You can check using your terminal to navigate to your root directory and running `gem install bundler`

## Install

Once you have downloaded the repository, navigate the terminal into the routerally_cli directory. Run `bundler install` to download the necessary gems for the application.

## Running Route Rally

In order to run Route Rally, you must first make sure that the executable file in the bin/ directory has executable permissions. You can do this my running `chmod -x bin/routerally`. Once that is taken care of, Route Rally is good to go! You can execute from the cli directory by running `bin/routerally`

NOTE: you will need the latitude and longitude of the locations in decimal format.
